Staxona Virus
Version 0.1

A pandemic for Staxel.

==========

Lydocia is patient zero. She infected the rest of us. Mark and I caught it and now we spread the disease to the rest of you. Stay safe and wear your mask to protect others. Be clever and you and your town might come out of this alive.

We want this to bring some levity into your life in dark times. If you enjoyed this mod, please consider donating to a trusted local or international charity helping in the fight against COVID-19. And if you can't afford to donate money, donate the gift of your blood to help save lives instead.
